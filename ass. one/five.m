Sure, here's a short explanation of the use of each file type in MATLAB:

1. `.m` files: These are MATLAB script files that contain code to be executed. They are used to write and run MATLAB programs, including scripts and functions.

2. `.mat` files: These are binary data files used to store variables and data in MATLAB. They are useful for saving and loading large datasets or complex variables for later use.

3. `.fig` files: These are binary files used to save MATLAB figures and graphical user interfaces (GUIs). They preserve the appearance and interactive elements of plots and GUIs for reuse or modification.
